## Installation

Download all files. Then using the terminal run npm install. The user will then run the schema followed by the seeds. The original version 
used mysql to run these to create the necessary tables. 

## Usage

The user will then use the terminal to enter node index.js to initiate the program. There will be a series of prompts to walk the user 
through the options; view departments, view roles, view employees, add role, add department, add employee, or update employee.
